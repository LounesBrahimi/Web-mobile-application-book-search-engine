# Web-mobile-application-book-search-engine

The project consists in developing a web/mobile application offering a search engine for a certain library of text
documents. The first requirement is about the data layer : one need to collect sufficiently many text documents, either by
hard-storage on disk, or pointers to contents on distant servers such as at The Gutenberg Projectâ€™s. The minimum size of
the library must be 1664 books. The minimum size of each book must be 104
(ten to the four; ten thousand) words.
